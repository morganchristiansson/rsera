phpSERA - Search Engine Ranking Analyzer

INSTALL (2004-04-15)

Note: no security is dealed with here. I strongly recommend adding
security layers when using PHP and MySQL. Please visit www.mysql.com
and www.php.net and read the manuals! 

PHP-4.0.6< is required for some functions (like is_numeric).

NOTE: if you get the following error message from phpSERA:
 "Fatal error: Call to a member function of a non-object"

...then I suggest verifying the DB_USER/DB_PASS/DB_NAME 
values in global.inc.php!

1. Installation

    For quick installation follow these steps:

    1. Extract the package:
         tar -xzvf phpsera-<version>.tgz
         cd phpsera-<version>

    2. Create a new MySQL database, if necessary:
         mysql -e 'create database <dbname>'

    3. Import the tables:
         mysql <dbname> < stuff/sql/sera_struct.sql

    4. Optionally, add the recent SE presets (recommended):

         mysql <dbname> < stuff/sql/sera_presets.sql

    5. Edit global.inc.php to suite your configuration.
       NOTE: to draw the trend graphs, a TrueType font is needed.
       Place it on your server and use it's ABSOLUTE PATH for the
       $FONTFILE value.
    
    6. Point your browser to /html and figure it out :)
       Or, configure /html as DocumentRoot in your Apache 
       config and access /, ofcourse. I recommend the latter!

3. Bug reporting and support

    Bugs and suggestions are welcome.
    Send them to opensource at koot.biz!

4. Other DBMSs than MySQL
  
    29/30 July 2003, I integrated the ADODB abstraction layer. Depending
    of the portability of the SQL statements I used (between the different 
    DBMSs), it may very well work with other DBMSs like PostgreSQL, mSQL, 
    etc. If you manage to get phpSERA to work on another DBMS, I would 
    be grateful if you send me the changes you made, including a dump of
    the database structure. Send them to opensource at koot.biz!
