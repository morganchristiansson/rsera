rSERA - Search Engine Ranking Analyzer
---------
TODO (2004-05-04)

This is a summary of future changes/additions to phpSERA. Suggestions
made by others are listed below.

- rebuild phpSERA from scratch with pure object orientation (php5?)

- integrate tidy.sf.net into phpSERA so phpSERA can actually
  'understand' the result page i.s.o. those damn regex's

- support multiple result pages (search depth)

- support for SEs like "T-Online.de", which don't display 
  URLs in their results but some stupid redirect link
  (make SERA look for the domainname rather than the full URL, 
  this might work for redirect links which contain your domain
  name in a parameter)

- make sense of how to count sponsored links, as they should 
  NEVER have any influence to the analysis 

- handle anti-SERA techniques such as altavista and yahoo 
  use (changing HTML on the fly to avoid pattern analysis)

- automatic centralized update of the definitions for the engines from your site or other developers.

- Simple (or nearly :)) improvements
... It would be a real improvement to have not two text fields for start 
end stop regexps, but two text areas with the new lines automatically 
converted to "\n" when saving in the DB. In the 99% of cases finding the 
start and end point if just a metter of copying tags, escaping slashes, and 
counting \n's to place.
... Why not kindly ask the user if it's ok to send a notification to you 
about the changes they do to the search engine database? Just an email with 
the UPDATE ...


- Ideas, feature requests, call them as you prefer :D
... More pages, is as simple as adding two columns in the search engines : 
pageparam e pagestep, and setting limit on th number of pages to be scanned
... Regular expression urls, i don't want to specify more urls for my site, 
but something like "http:\/\/.*\.thebug\.it\/.*" , and then have php sera 
tell me the first occurence of a matching url, and which url it is. It's 
enought to parse the matching href.
... It would be really nice to have on the database a dump of the complete 
search result, not only of the indicated url but also of competitors, to 
obtain a graph relating not my site for the various keywords, but my site 
and his competitors dancing on the same keyword. The method could be the 
same : i tell the system the regex urls of my competitors, and it saves the 
ones that matches and their positions.

3) I'll want to do comparisons between different sites but to do it, I need to know if it's the same keyphrase for differents site or not. Actually, the same keyphrase is added twice in the table keyphrases if it's for 2 different sites. So I need to separate keyphrases & websites in two differents tables.  (add a join table with only 2 fields, zt_id & ws_id, and take ws_id out the keyphrases table).
